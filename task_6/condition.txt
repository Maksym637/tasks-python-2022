information:

*args and **kwargs:
- There are two types of arguments in a function which are positional arguments
  (declared by a name only) and keyword arguments (declared by a name and a default value).
- When a function is called, values for positional arguments must be given.
  Keywords arguments are optional (they take the default value if not specified).
- *args collects the positional arguments that are not explicitly defined and
  store them in a tuple.
- **kwargs does the same as *args but for keyword arguments. They are stored in a
  dictionary because keyword arguments are stored as name-value pairs.
- Python does not allow positional arguments to follow keyword arguments.
  Thus, we first declare positional argumets and then keyword argumets.

Tasks:
> Exercise 1:
Create a function that finds the average value of the arguments

> Exercise 2:
Create function for different data

> Exercise 3:
Create decorator for fibonacci function
