> Exercise 1:
Write a program that determines whether the Point(x,y) is in the shaded area or not.

> Exercise 2:
Write a program that prints the input number from 1 to 100.
But for multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

> Exercise 3:
- Simulate the one round of play for baccarat game
- Rules:
  - cards have a point value:
    - the 2 through 9 cards in each suit
      are worth face value (in points);
    - the 10, jack, queen, and king have
      no point value (i.e. are worth zero);
    - aces are worth 1 point;
  - Sum the values of cards. If total is 
    more than 9 reduce 10 from result
  - Player is not allowed to play another
    cards like joker.
