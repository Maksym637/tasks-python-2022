Create a Circle class defined by its radius (r) as an attribute of the instance class, 
with the methods "Area", which returns the area of â€‹â€‹the circle, as well as the method
"Increase" with one parameter - how many times to increase, which increases radius in a 
given number of times.

Also create a descendant class Ring, with an additional instance attribute class - inner 
radius (rin), inherited from the parent class radius will indicate the outer radius. 
Redefine method "Area" as the difference between the area of â€‹â€‹the outer circle minus the 
area internal. Also exceed the "Increase" method to increase it also the inner radius.
