> Exercise 1:
Develop Rectangle and ArrayRectangles with a predefined functionality.

On a Low level it is obligatory:
To develop Rectangle class with following content:
- 2 closed float sideA and sideB (sides A and B of the rectangle)
- Constructor with two parameters a and b (parameters specify rectangle sides)
- Constructor with a parameter a (parameter specify side A of a rectangle, side B is always equal to 5)
- Method GetSideA, returning value of the side A
- Method GetSideB, returning value of the side B
- Method Area, calculating and returning the area value
- Method Perimeter, calculating and returning the perimeter value
- Method IsSquare, checking whether current rectangle is shape square or not. Returns true if the shape is square and false in another case.
- Method ReplaceSides, swapping rectangle sides

On Advanced level also needed:
Complete Level Low Assignment
Develop class ArrayRectangles, in which declare:
- Private field rectangle_array - array of rectangles
- Constructor creating an empty array of rectangles with length n
- Constructor that receives an arbitrary amount of objects of type Rectangle or an array of objects of type Rectangle.
- Method AddRectangle that adds a rectangle of type Rectangle to the array on the nearest free place and returning true, or returning false,
  if there is no free space in the array
- Method NumberMaxArea, that returns order number (index) of the rectangle with the maximum area value (numeration starts with zero)
- Method NumberMinPerimeter, that returns order number (index) of the rectangle with the minimum perimeter value (numeration starts with zero)
- Method NumberSquare, that returns the number of squares in the array of rectangles
