> Exercise 1:
Transpose a matrix
example:
Original matrix is:
[0, 1, 9]
[9, 8, 5]
[7, 3, 1]
[3, 4, 0]

Transposed matrix is:
[0, 9, 7, 3]
[1, 8, 3, 4]
[9, 5, 1, 0]

> Exercise 2:
Factorial ---> n! ---> 5! = 120

> Exercise 3:
Fibonacci sequence
For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers

> Exercise 4:
Binary representation
For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the "1" in the binary representation of n
example:
22 ---> 10110 --> sum is 3
